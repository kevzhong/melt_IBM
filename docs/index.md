## Lagrangian melting front-tracking IBM documentation

This documentation provides a few technical details on the implementation of the `melt_IBM` code.

Most of the technical details on the method are prepared in the following article:

```
Zhong, K., Howland, C. J., Lohse, D. and Verzicco, R. A front-tracking immersed-boundary framework for simulating Lagrangian melting problems (*under review for the Journal of Computational Physics*). Available on arXiv here [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20244)
```

Some of the details in the article will be repeated here in this documentation for completeness. But the main purpose of this documentation is to highlight some more specific details not mentioned in the article (mostly specific to implementation) and to walkthrough some of the code.

This is a work in progress.
